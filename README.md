# RuES - Expression Evaluation as Service 

RuES is a minimal JMES expression evaluation side-car, that uses [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/), and it can handle 
arbitrary JSON. Which effectively makes it general purpose logical expression evaluation engine, just like 
[some](https://zerosteiner.github.io/rule-engine/) Python libraries that used to evaluate 
logical expression. This in turn can allow you implement complex stuff like Rule engine, 
RBAC, or Policy engines etc. 

Here is what makes RuES special:

 - **Lean and Zippy** - Checkout initial benchmarks below. Under `20 MB` with single CPU one will easily do 10K RPS. 
 - **Zero restarts** - Add/remove rules on fly by making changes in `rules.hjson` without restarting.
 - **HTTP & JSON** - Ubiquitous! No custom protocols, no shenanigans.
 - **UNIX philosophy** - Only evaluates rules, no fancy hooks or integrations. Dead simple!

## Why?

A very obvious question to ask might be, why RuES and why not just use a library? RuES can be beneficial in large 
scale scenarios with following benefits:

 - **Unified and consistent rules** - No need to deal with library differences, specially in a polyglot stack you
   won't have to worry about any inconsistencies, performance issues, or library maintenances.
 - **Isolated and scalable** - While embedded libraries can have a broader attack surface the isolated process
   gives you sandbox, and due to being lightweight have it as a sidecar giving you sub-millisecond latencies. 
   This not only allows developers to hand off security to the right team, but also allows you to scale 
   with your system.
 - **Centrally managed** - Allowing you to have centrally managed deployments, and rules. Changing rules doesn't
   even require a new deployment. The rules are live reloaded. That means with 0 downtime you can add/modify 
   rules on the fly. 

## Usage

Make sure you have `rules.hjson` in your current working directory when launching `rues`. Given following example
rules:

```hjson
{
  example_one: "value == `2`"
  example_two: "a.b"
}
```

Each rule is exposed under `/eval/{rule_name}` as `POST` endpoint, which in turn can be posted payload to evaluate
the expression. Simple use `curl` to test:

```
> curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/eval/example_one -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"value": 2}'
{"Success":{"expression":"value == `2`","name":"example_one","is_truthy":true,"value":true}}
> curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/eval/example_two -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"a": {"b": "Hello"}}'
{"Success":{"expression":"a.b","name":"example_two","is_truthy":true,"value":"Hello"}}
```

Response object contains `Success` if evaluation was successful. e.g.
```json
{
   "Success": {
      "name": "filter_active",
      "expression": "[?isActive] | length(@)",
      "is_truthy": true,
      "value": 2
   }
}
```

Response will have an `Error` if there was an error in expression or there was some violation while evaluating the 
expression (in which case `reason` will contain a reason):

```json
{
   "Error": {
      "name": "filter_registered",
      "expression": "[?matched('^201\\d', registered)] | length(@)",
      "reason": "Runtime error: Call to undefined function matched (line 0, column 9)\n[?matched('^201\\d', registered)] | length(@)\n         ^\n"
   }
}
```

Response will have a `NotFound` if the specified rule is not found:

```json
{
   "NotFound": {
      "name": "filter_register"
   }
}
```

### Batch Rules API 

Many times you need evaluate a set of rules against a payload. RuES supports evaluating a context against multiple 
rules using batch API. Given the rules file:

```hjson
{
  example_one: "c == `2`"
  example_two: "a.b"
}
```

One can invoke batch api by simply invoking `/eval` with `POST` data of:
```json
{
   "context": {
      "c": 3,
      "a": {
         "b": true
      } 
   },
   "rules": ["example_one", "example_two", "example_three"]
}
```

The rules will be evaluated in sequence of order they were passed in, and server will return an array response:

```json
[
   {"Success":{"expression":"c == `2`","name":"example_one","is_truthy":false,"value":false}},
   {"Success":{"expression":"a.b","name":"example_two","is_truthy":true,"value":true}},
   {"NotFound":{"name":"example_three"}}
]
```

## Additional functions

In addition to [built-in functions](https://jmespath.org/proposals/functions.html#built-in-functions) of JMES, there 
additional are following additional functions:

 - âœ… `string[] match(expref string $regex, string $element)` - Returns an array of all groups of regex matching 
   or a `null` if there is no match. Regex specs can be found [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex). 
   Regexes are compiled and cached in LRU order. The given Regex has to be an expression with string 
   literal e.g. `&'\d+'` this is required so that regexes are always string literal and never 
   variables eliminating any possibility of regex injection via variables, preventing any
   exploits or accidental explosion of regex patterns. Examples:
   ```jmes
   [?match(&'^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$', username)]
   [?match(&'^[a-z0-9_-]{3,16}$', 'user_123')]
   [?match(&'([12]\d{3}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01]))', date)]
   ```
 - âœ… `bool valid_email(string $element)` - Returns `true` or `false` based on email format. In 
   addition to formatting it also excludes temporary email addresses. Examples:
   ```jmes
   [?valid_email('user123@gmail.com')]
   [?!valid_email('janette@guerrillamailblock.com')]
   [?valid_email(contact.email)]
   ```
 - âœ… `object[] phone_number(string $element, [optional_country_codes string[]])` - Returns parsed phone number for
   international (when `optional_country_codes` is not passed) or given country format. If the number is not valid, 
   it is omitted from results, in case of empty result `null` is returned. Examples:
   ```jmes
   > phone_number('033316005', ['nz'])
   [{"carrier":null,"country":"NZ","country_code":64,"from":"NZ","national":33316005,"national_zeros":0,"valid":true}]
   > phone_number('(541) 754-3010', ['us', 'fr', 'de'])
   [{"carrier":null,"country":"US","country_code":1,"from":"US","national":5417543010,"national_zeros":0,"valid":true},{"carrier":null,"country":"DE","country_code":49,"from":"DE","national":5417543010,"national_zeros":0,"valid":true}]
   > phone_number('(089) / 636-48018', ['us', 'fr', 'de'])
   [{"carrier":null,"country":"DE","country_code":49,"from":"DE","national":8963648018,"national_zeros":0,"valid":true}]
   > phone_number('(541) 754-3010', ['nz', 'ch'])
   null
   > phone_number('+33-655-562-025')
   {"carrier":null,"country":"FR","country_code":33,"from":null,"national":655562025,"national_zeros":0,"valid":true}
   ```
 - ðŸš§ `number parse_datetime(string $element, string $format = 'rfc3339')` (To be implemented yet) - Converts 
   datetime in given format to a timestamp. The timestamp then in turn can be used to 
   do comparisons or reformatting. 
 - ðŸš§ `string to_datetime(number $element, , string $format = 'rfc3339')` (To be implemented yet) - Converts
   timestamp to a given string format.
 - ðŸš§ `bool in_geo_fence(number[] $center, number $radius, number[] $element)` (To be implemented yet) - Returns `true`
   or `false` if the `$element` lies within the `$radius` of `$center`.
 - ðŸš§ `number[][] filter_in_geo_fence(number[] $center, number $radius, number[][] $elements) ` (To be implemented yet) - 
   Returns all elements that lie within geo fence of given radius and center.
 - ðŸš§ `bool match_glob(string $pattern, string $element)` (To be implemented yet) - Returns `true` or `false` 
   if the `$element` is a glob match of the `$pattern`.

## Configuration variables

 - `CONFIG_PATH` - path to rules file, file can be `.json`, `.yaml`, or `.hjson`. Default: `rules.hjson`
 - `BIND_ADDRESS` - service address to bind to. Default: `0.0.0.0:8080`

## Benchmarks

My brief stress testing shows with a single CPU core (single worker), 3 rules, and payload size of 1.6 KB. Server was 
easily able to handle 10K RPS (even with sustained load) under **19 MB of RSS** memory footprint, and a p99 of 4ms.
